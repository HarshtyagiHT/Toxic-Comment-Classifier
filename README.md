# Toxic-Comment-Classifier
The motivation behind our project is the multitude of online forums, where-in people participate actively and make comments. Comments can be derogatory, abusing and they 
should be managed accordingly for wellbeing of all users. Blocking or reporting can be further action after classifying. 
The idea of our project and the dataset has been taken from kaggle. Under the name of toxic comment classification challenge, it aims to identify and classify online toxic 
comments. It is being conducted as research by the Conversation AI team, which is an initiative by Jigsaw and Google.
